# Open Source Computing

## What is Open Source Computing?

Open source computing refers to the use of open source software and hardware in the field of computing. Open source products are those that are released with licenses that allow source code or design to be used, modified, and distributed freely by anyone. This collaborative and transparent approach encourages innovation, community involvement, and peer review.

In broader context, open source computing encompasses not only software and hardware, but also access to data, open standards, and open methodologies.
